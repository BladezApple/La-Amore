      <h3 class="termheading">Acceptance of Terms</h3>
      <p class="termtext">
        By accessing or using the La Amore website, you agree to be legally
        bound by these Terms of Service, along with our Privacy Policy. These
        terms govern all purchases, interactions, and use of our website.
      </p>

      <h3 class="termheading">Product Information & Accuracy</h3>
      <p class="termtext">
        We make every effort to ensure our product descriptions, pricing, and
        images are accurate and up to date. However, minor variations in color
        or design may occur due to lighting and display differences. La Amore
        reserves the right to correct errors, omissions, or update product
        details at any time without notice.
      </p>

      <h3 class="termheading">Visual Representation and real-world Product</h3>
      <p class="termtext">
        Some product images displayed on the La Amore website are AI-generated
        mockups designed to represent the look, fit, and style of our garments.
        While these visuals closely reflect the final product, they are intended
        for illustrative purposes only.
        <br />
        Due to differences in screen settings, lighting, and the nature of
        digital rendering, actual product colors, textures, or proportions may
        vary slightly in person. These minor differences are normal and do not
        constitute a product fault.
        <br />
        We encourage customers to consult our product descriptions, fabric
        details, and size guides before placing an order. For additional
        assistance, our support team is available to answer any questions.
      </p>

      <h3 class="termheading">Orders & Payments</h3>
      <p class="termtext">
        All purchases must be paid in full at the time of checkout through
        accepted payment methods including credit/debit cards or supported
        gateways (e.g., Stripe, Paypal). We reserve the right to cancel any
        order due to suspected fraud, payment issues, or availability
        limitations. You will be notified promptly in such cases.
      </p>

      <h3 class="termheading">Shipping & Delivery</h3>
      <p class="termtext">
        We process and deliver orders within 14 business days for local orders,
        and 20-25 business days for International orders. Delivery timelines
        vary by location and courier service. International orders may be
        subject to customs duties or import taxes, which are the buyer’s
        responsibility. We try our best to deliver orders as soon as possible,
        however, La Amore is not liable for delays caused by third-party
        shipping providers.
      </p>

      <h3 class="termheading">Returns, Exchanges & Refunds</h3>
      <p class="termtext">
        We accept returns within 5 days of receiving your order, provided the
        items are unwashed, and in their original condition with tags intact.
        Refunds, where eligible, will be processed either to the original
        payment method or an alternative method if required.
        <br />
        Please note that sale, customized, or promotional items are
        non-returnable unless received in a faulty condition. Refunds are
        processed within 10 business days of receiving the returned item.
        <br />
        If the return or exchange is due to personal preference (e.g., disliking
        the item), the customer is responsible for delivery/shipping charges.
        However, in the case of faulty or incorrect items, La Amore will cover
        all related shipping costs.
